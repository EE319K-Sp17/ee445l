# Lab 10: DC Motor Control

## Objectives

We will spin a brushed DC motor at a constant speed using an integral controller. Two switches will allow the operator to increase or decrease the desired speed. A tachometer will be used to measure the motor speed. A background periodic interrupt will execute the three steps of a digital controller.

Additionally we will calculate error as the difference between actual and desired speed, execute a control equation to determine the next output, and adjust the power to the actuator in an attempt to drive the error to zero.

See our [requirements doc](Requirements.md).

## Analysis and Discussion

1. Torque - The tendency of a force to rotate an object about an axis, fulcrum, or pivot. Just as a force is a push or a pull, a torque can be thought of as a twist to an object. It is units of Newton-meters or Nâ€¢m

3. Current to drive the motor was the most important parameter. We had to chose the TIP120 because the 2N2222 did not provide enough current gain for the motor. The interface from the TM4C provides enough base current to the TIP120 to drive the motor.

4. Direct Motor Control. We could have just calculated the PWM nescessary for each speed and set it accordingly. It would have removed jitter from the motor speed.
