# Lab 10: DC Motor Control

## Objectives

We will spin a brushed DC motor at a constant speed using an integral controller. Two switches will allow the operator to increase or decrease the desired speed. A tachometer will be used to measure the motor speed. A background periodic interrupt will execute the three steps of a digital controller.

Additionally we will calculate error as the difference between actual and desired speed, execute a control equation to determine the next output, and adjust the power to the actuator in an attempt to drive the error to zero.

See our [requirements doc](Requirements.md).

## Measurement Data



## Analysis and Discussion

1. Torque - The tendency of a force to rotate an object about an axis, fulcrum, or pivot. Just as a force is a push or a pull, a torque can be thought of as a twist to an object. It is units of Newton-meters or Nâ€¢m
