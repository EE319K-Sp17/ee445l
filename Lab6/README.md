# Lab 6: Introduction to PCB Design

For this lab we will be designing and ordering a PCB version of our [Lab 3](../Lab3/README.md).

## Preparation

2. We have chosen the Tenergy Premium 1.2V 2500mAh Ni-MH AA Rechargeable Battery as our battery for this PCB. Two of these in series should provide the proper voltage and enough current to last a while. And they're rechargeable so we can replace them with charged ones easily. We could use either of the following products:
    - http://www.batteryspace.com/ni-mhbatteries.aspx
    - http://www.batteryspace.com/nimhpacks24-48v.aspx
3. We have chosen to use a small enclosure with enough space to house batteries. This case seems to fit the bill:
