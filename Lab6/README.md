# Lab 6: Introduction to PCB Design

For this lab we will be designing and ordering a PCB version of our [Lab 3](../Lab3/README.md).

## Preparation

2. We have chosen the Samsung Li-Ion 18650 Cylindrical 7.4V 2800mAh Flat Top Rechargeable Battery w/ PCM Protection as our battery for this PCB. Two of these in series should provide the proper voltage and enough current to last a while. And they're rechargeable so we can replace them with charged ones easily. We could use either of the following products:

3. We have chosen to use a medium enclosure with enough space to house batteries. This case seems to fit the bill:
