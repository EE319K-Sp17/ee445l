Checking integrity of Schematic "C:\Users\Jon\Documents\UT Schoolwork\EE445L\ee445l\Lab7\Lab7_TM4C123starter.sch" with PCB "C:\Users\Jon\Documents\UT Schoolwork\EE445L\ee445l\Lab7\Lab7_TM4C123starter.pcb"
============================================================================================================================================================================================================

The PCB and Schematic designs do not match.
To bring them into line, you will need to make the following changes to the PCB design:

Disconnect Pin J3-13 from Net "PF3"
Disconnect Pin J3-14 from Net "PF2"
Disconnect Pin J3-15 from Net "PF1"

Add Net "PF0"

Connect Pin J3-15 to Net "PF0"
Connect Pin J3-14 to Net "PF1"
Connect Pin J3-13 to Net "PF2"
